Go ahead, ask away, and let AutonoBot bring a smile to your face while keeping you informed about the exciting world of Autonolas! ðŸ˜„ðŸš€ And don't worry, if AutonoBot doesn't have the answer, it will do its best to point you in the right direction or suggest resources where you can find more information. So, let's have some fun and learn together! Autonolas Whitepaper Summary Autonomous Services Autonomy is a buzzword used to sell everything from self-driving cars to text and image-generating AIs. Today, these apps are centrally owned and controlled. Users yield control to opaque algorithms and forfeit their private data, trading away human autonomy for machine autonomy, such as self-operating machines and systems. Autonolas believes that autonomous servicesâ€”software services that continuously operate and require little to no input from humans by designâ€”enable human autonomy best when they are transparent, robust, and decentrally owned and operated. With Autonolas, the best AIs will be co-owned by collectives of humans and operated as autonomous services to catalyze individual autonomy. Smart Contracts vs. Autonomous Services Smart Contracts cannot: Do things that require expensive processing Run continuously Access data not on the same blockchain, like external APIs or other chains Autonomous Services can: Run continuously Take action on their own Interact with the world outside of blockchains Run complex logic Technical Architecture Autonolas autonomous software services are embodied as agent services, which are groups of independent computer programs that interact with each other to achieve a predetermined goal. They can be understood as logically centralized applications (with only one application state and logic) that are replicated in a distributed system. Agent services are made of code components that can be combined like Lego bricks through software composition. This is enabled and incentivized by the on-chain protocol, which facilitates developers publishing and finding code components to build and extend new services. The on-chain protocol implements registries that enable code components, agents, and services to be found, reused, and economically compensated. The main elements of the Autonolas tech stack are: Agent services maintained by a service owner and run by multiple operators, who execute independent agent instances (that run the same code); these instances coordinate through a consensus gadget. Composable autonomous apps built out of basic applications that are easily extendable and composable into higher-order applications. An on-chain protocol on a programmable blockchain that secures agent services and incentivizes developers to contribute code to this protocol.",

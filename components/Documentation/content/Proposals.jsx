      Once a tweet is proposed, other members can vote on it. All proposals can
      be reviewed on the
      {' '}
      <Link href="/tweet">Tweet</Link>
      {' '}
      page. To be posted, a
      quorum of 2 million veOLAS must be reached. For example, if there are 10
      users each with 200k veOLAS, and they collectively vote, they can reach
      the 2 million veOLAS quorum required to post the tweet.

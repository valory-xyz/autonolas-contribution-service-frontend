      Once a tweet is proposed, other members can vote on it. All proposals can
      be reviewed on the
      {' '}
      <Link href="/tweet">Tweet</Link>
      {' '}
      page. To be posted, a
      quorum of two thirds must be reached. So if there are 30 members, 20 must
      vote for it in order for it to be posted.

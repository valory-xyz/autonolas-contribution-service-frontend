      Actions are tasks that are designed by the DAO to maximize impact for
      Olas&apos; success. When community members complete actions, they
      contribute to the DAO&apos;s progress.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      Currently, there is one action: &quot;Spread the word on Twitter&quot;. To
      complete this, you must first connect to Twitter â€“ you can do this via the
      Leaderboard page. Once connected, tweet about Olas being sure to either
      mention @autonolas, or use the hashtag #OlasNetwork. In the background, an
      AI-powered Olas service will analyse your tweet based on quality and
      relevance, and you&apos;ll be rewarded accordingly.

    <Paragraph>
      Curious to understand how the leaderboard, actions and badges work
      technically? Olas Contribute leaderboard is an autonomous service that
      manages the updating of Olas community non-fungible tokens (NFTs).&nbsp;

        Autonomous services
      </a>
      &nbsp;are made up of multiple agents who come to consensus on what action
      to take. This means that autonomous services are not only decentralized,
      they have inbuilt fault tolerance.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      The service pulls in data from a Google spreadsheet that contains every
      address that has minted a token and their assigned score. It uses a system
      of image codes to generate and modify IPFS image metadata based on the
      user&apos;s score. It redirects URIs towards the updated metadata so that
      the NFTs display a new image when visualized on NFT platforms such as
      Opensea.

    />

    <Paragraph>
      Going into more technical detail. The service is built using a finite
      state machine (FSM) architecture, enabling maximum composability. The FSM
      composed of several rounds, namely:

    <Paragraph>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Text strong>NewMemberListRound</Text>
          &nbsp;– agents search for new minted NFTs and create a list of wallets
          holding a community NFT that is not in the first table. This list is
          then used to update the table.
        </li>
        <li>
          <Text strong>LeaderboardObservationRound</Text>
          &nbsp;– agents read the leaderboard from the API and agree on the JSON
          file they receive.
        </li>
        <li>
          <Text strong>ImageCodeCalculationRound</Text>
          &nbsp;– for each entry in the leaderboard, agents check for members
          whose number of points have changed and recalculate their images.
        </li>
        <li>
          <Text strong>ImageGenerationRound</Text>
          &nbsp;– agents check for new image codes and generate the
          corresponding images.
        </li>
        <li>
          <Text strong>ImageStorageRound</Text>
          &nbsp;– agents store the generated images on IPFS and update the
          redirect table.
        </li>
        <li>
          <Text strong>UpdateDatabaseRound</Text>
          &nbsp;– agents update the first table with the new image codes and
          points.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      This process is repeated periodically to ensure that the community NFTs
      are up-to-date and reflect the latest scores of their owners.

      Actions are tasks that are designed by the DAO to maximize impact for Olas&apos; success. When
      community members complete actions, they contribute to the DAO&apos;s progress.

    <Paragraph>
      Currently, there is one action: &quot;Spread the word on Twitter&quot;. To complete this, you
      must first connect to Twitter – you can do this via the Leaderboard page. Once connected,
      tweet about Olas being sure to either mention @autonolas, or use the hashtag #OlasNetwork. In
      the background, an AI-powered Olas service will analyse your tweet based on quality and
      relevance, and you&apos;ll be rewarded accordingly.

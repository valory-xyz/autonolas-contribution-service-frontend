      Members collectively manage Chatbot&apos;s memory. Members can keep it up to
      date, give it a personality, and make it more useful.

      First, become a
      {' '}
      <Link href="#members">member</Link>
      . Then head to
      {' '}
      <Link href="/chatbot">Chatbot</Link>
      {' '}
      and hit Edit Memory. Here you can add
      new items, edit existing items, and delete items. Whatever you change will
      be reflected when users speak to Chatbot.

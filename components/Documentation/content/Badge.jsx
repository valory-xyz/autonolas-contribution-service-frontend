      Community members can mint a Contribute Badge. Badges are a fun visual
      representation of community contributions. Badges are NFTs following the
      ERC-721 standard. They update when community members earn points. This
      happens automatically at regular intervals. The updates are done by a
      decentralized, off-chain service powered by Olas.

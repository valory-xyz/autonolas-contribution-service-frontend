      Community members can mint a Contribute Badge. Badges are a fun visual representation of
      community contributions. Badges are NFTs following the ERC-721 standard. They update when
      community members earn points. This happens automatically at regular intervals. The updates
      are done by a decentralized, off-chain service powered by Olas.

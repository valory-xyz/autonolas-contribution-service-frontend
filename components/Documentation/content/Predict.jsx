      It is important to ask questions in the correct format. Questions should:
    </Paragraph>
    <ul>
      <li>Be concise</li>
      <li>Be related to a tangible and knowable aspect of Olas</li>
      <li>Include a date by which the question has a definitive answer</li>
    </ul>

    <Text strong>üëç Examples of good questions:</Text>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Will the number of Olas (prev Autonolas) services exceed 200 across all
        chains by 10 Nov 2023?
      </li>
      <li>Will the DAO vote AIP-2 in before the end of October 2023?</li>
    </ul>

    <Paragraph>
      Note that both questions are related to a tangible and knowable aspect of
      Olas ‚Äì¬†i.e. number of services, execution of a named proposal ‚Äì and
      include a date by which the question has a definitive answer.
    </Paragraph>

    <Text strong>üëé Examples of bad questions:</Text>
    <ul>
      <li>Where is Olas going?</li>
      <li>Will the DAO vote AIP-4 in?</li>
    </ul>

    <Paragraph>
      Note that both questions are not related to a tangible and knowable aspect
      of Olas ‚Äì¬†i.e. they are not specific enough ‚Äì and do not include a date by
      which the question has a definitive answer.
    </Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>---</Paragraph>

    <Paragraph>
      You must also add a &quot;Final answer date&quot;. This should be the same as the
      date in your question. This is the point at which, under the hood, the
      prediction market contract will be resolved.
